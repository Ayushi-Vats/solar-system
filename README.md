# 🌌 3D Solar System Visualization

A real-time interactive 3D model of our solar system built using [Three.js](https://threejs.org/). This project demonstrates a scalable, animated orbital system complete with:

- Glowing Sun
- Orbiting planets with individual speeds and sizes
- Saturn’s ring system
- Speed controls for each planet
- Tooltip-based planetary identification
- A responsive and accessible user interface

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔭 Realistic spatial simulation of 8 planets and the Sun
- 🌞 Custom glow effect around the Sun using canvas-based textures
- 🪐 Saturn's ring rendered with semi-transparent geometry
- 🎛️ Dynamic sliders to control individual planetary speeds
- 🖱️ Tooltips on hover showing planet names
- 📱 Responsive layout and smooth controls

## 🎮 Controls

- **Play / Pause Button** — Start or stop the animation
- **Sliders** — Modify the orbit speed of each planet
- **Tooltip** — Hover on any planet to see its name
- **Hamburger Menu** — Open/close control panel

## 🧠 Learning Goals

This project helps in understanding:

- 3D object rendering using Three.js
- Orbital mechanics simulation
- Use of lights, shaders, textures in WebGL
- Scene graph management in a 3D space
